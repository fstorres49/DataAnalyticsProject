# data Folder
Contains the data used in the project. It is divided in 2 folders: Home_price_mortgages and Wage_salaries. 
The first one is data obtained from the National Association of realtors: https://www.nar.realtor/. It was used with their permission.
The second one is data obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). U.S. Department of Commerce: https://www.bea.gov/.
Each folder has an R script that was used to clean the data. Also, the files that each script uses and their respective output are there. However, in the Wage_salaries foler you will find the CAINC4.zip. This .zip has the raw data obtained from the BEA and also the defitions of the variables among other important files.
